<p>I graduated from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China and I majored in Finance, Accounting and Management. I took Introduction to Data Science as my elective and had an overall understanding of programming languages. This experience further inspired me to apply for MAM in LBS.</p>
<p>As for my hobbies, I’m a huge musical fan and London is the great place to see musical shows, so I’m really looking forward to my life in London!</p>
