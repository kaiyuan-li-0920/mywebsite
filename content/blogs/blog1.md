title: About Me
---

I graduated from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China and I majored in Finance, Accounting and Management. I took Introduction to Data Science as my elective and had an overall understanding of programming languages. This experience further inspired me to apply for MAM in LBS.

As for my hobbies, I'm a huge musical fan and London is the great place to see musical shows, so I'm really looking forward to my life in London for the following year!
